# Python Practice & Projects

A public portfolio of my Python work – from fundamentals and small exercises to larger, real-world projects.

## Structure
- **01-basics**: syntax, control flow, functions
- **02-data-structures**: lists, dicts, sets, tuples
- **03-algorithms**: problem solving + complexity
- **04-mini-projects**: small practical apps/scripts
- **05-projects**: larger projects with clearer structure

## Goals
- Build strong Python fundamentals
- Write clean, readable code
- Gradually move toward real projects (APIs, data, automation, etc.)
